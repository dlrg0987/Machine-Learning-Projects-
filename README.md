# Machine-Learning-Projects
Contains all Machine learning coding projects from 'Machine Learning' course on Coursera taught by Andrew Ng (URL: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
This course consisted on 10 weeks of material teaching machine learning algorithms for both the supervised learning and unsupervised learning paradigmns. The taught material was assessed through weekly quizzes and graded programming projects (which are stored in this repository).

In total there are 8 programming projects/exercises that were assessed in this course:
1) Linear Regression (Week 2 programming project of course)
2) Logistic Regression (Week 3 programming project of course)
3) Multi-Class Classification and Neural Networks (Week 4 programming project of course)
4) Neural Networks (Back-propagation) (Week 5 programming project of course)
5) Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance (Week 6 programming project of course)
6) Support Vector Machines (Week 7 programming project of course)
7) K-means Clustering and PCA (Week 8 programming project of course)
8) Anonomy Detection and Recommender Systems (Week 9 programming project of course)

The code for all projects is written in MATLAB.
